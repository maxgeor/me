        <p>Bad writing gets a bad wrap. When you don't write a lot, everything you write feels &quot;bad&quot; or
          &quot;not good yet&quot;, so you don't write or share anything.</p>
        <p>If aiming for &quot;good&quot; leads to no writing, then aiming for &quot;bad&quot; can be useful.</p>
        <h2>Quality?</h2>
        <p>What's &quot;bad&quot; anyways? Compared to what?</p>
        <p>Is &quot;bad&quot; writing long? How long?</p>
        <p>Is &quot;bad&quot; writing unclear? How unclear?</p>
        <p>If you write an article you think is bad, but it changes someone's life, is it still bad?</p>
        <p>There's no ruler. If your words aren't out there, their &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness&quot; mean
          nothing.</p>
        <h2>How about Marcus?</h2>
        <p>Marcus Aurelius (the Emperor of Rome) wasn't aiming for &quot;quality&quot; when writing to himself. Yet, his
          notes turned into Meditations &mdash; one of history's most enduring writings.</p>
        <p>Had he known they'd be read for centuries, he would have edited, re-edited, questioned, and ditch ideas
          entirely (if Meditations teaches us anything, it's that he was just as human the rest of us).</p>
        <p>If Marcus aimed for &quot;quality&quot;, how much wisdom would be lost?</p>
        <p>&mdash;</p>
        <p>The point of writing is to share ideas, not to write them well.</p>
        <p>Quality is important, but if you aren't shipping, bad will do.</p>
